This is a Chrome extension on desktop.

It displays the number of unread messages in your Google inbox (Inbox by Gmail).

Google Inbox OR Gmail Inbox OR Inbox by Gmail ( https://inbox.google.com ) is a really great product, but there is no extension for it in Chrome. I modifed the offical Gmail Checker to make this Google Inbox Checker. 

This extension will only show the number of unread emails, including those in bundles, but reminders would not be counted.

Check it in Chrome app store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-inbox-checker-inbo/llldafpkkdiljghncbdnkgfinfiifnig
